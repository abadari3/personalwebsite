    <p>
    We are a group of undergraduate students at Georgia Tech, who are using Computer Vision techniques to determine the speed of a car. Since one of the most visible and cutting edge applications of Computer Vision is in autonomous vehicles, we were interested in pursuing a topic dealing with self-driving cars, and are attempting to solve the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/commaai/speedchallenge">comma.ai programming challenge</a> as our project for CS 4476: Computer Vision.

    Problem Statement
    </h3>

    <p>
    The goal is to predict the speed of a car given its dashcam video. That is, given a dashcam video of a car, we want to assign each frame with the approximate instantaneous speed during that frame. Thus, we can model the entire car's journey from start to finish by referencing the speeds on the individual frames. <br><br>

    Expected Input: A 20fps video from the dashcam of a car<br>
    Expected Output: An estimated speed of the car for each video frame<br><br>

    There will be a training data which consists of a dashcam video and a text file indicating the true speed of the car per frame. Then, there will be a test video from the same dashcam in the same mounting position which we will use to estimate the speed of the car.
